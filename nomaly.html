    <h1>None will left</h1>

        By midday, the fog had ? into the forgotten, filling every c?, making it impossible to see more than a few ? ahead. We’ve started hearing forgotten, indistinct murmurs oming from the forgotten of the room. I’m starting to wonder if the office is part of Factory 12 after ?.

        The fos from last night returned, only this time, they were inside the forgotten with us. Every time we turned, forgotten was there. One of us I can’t remember who suggested we split up to find an exit. But each time we did, we somehow ended up back in the forgotten, no matter how far we walked.

        We woke up at dawn, but something was wrong. The fog hadn’t lifted it seemed thicker, ? to the forgotten like a second forgotten. The world felt too quiet. No wind, no birds, just the sound of our own memory, and something else, almost like a faint hum coming from beneath the forgotten.

    <p style="transform: rotate(180deg);">
        We can’t leave. ? won’t let us.
    </p>

    <p style="transform: rotate(180deg);">
        The map was still in our forgotten, but when we tried to retrace our forgotten to the road, the f? was gone. The office, which we thought we had camped near, looked unfamiliar, forgotten. Walls that hadn’t been there last night were now forgotten our way. One door, which had been locked before, stood slightly ajar, inviting us deeper inside.
