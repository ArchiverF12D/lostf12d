                <p>We thought it would be just another forgotten building.</p>
                <p>Our group, the Archivers, has been urban exploring old, decaying structures for years. It’s kind of our thing—documenting the abandoned and lost pieces of history. We never expected to stumble upon something that no one even knew existed.</p>
                <p>The office we found seemed no different at first. An old, forgotten place in one of the countless factories we’ve explored. The door was jammed, but nothing we hadn’t dealt with before. Inside, everything looked untouched by time. Desks covered in dust, yellowing papers spread out as if someone had just left in a hurry years ago.</p>
                <p>Then we found the safe. Hidden behind a bookshelf, it was an unexpected discovery. After hours of effort, we cracked it open, expecting maybe some old receipts or forgotten company files. But what we found was far stranger.</p>
                <p>Inside the safe were sealed documents,(maybe) government-issued, marked with redacted lines and heavy stamps. One document in particular caught our attention. It spoke about a place called Factory 12. No one in town—or anywhere—had ever mentioned it. There were cryptic mentions of classified projects and ‘anomalous incidents.’ The name Factory 12 appeared again and again. Yet, no location was ever mentioned. It was like it existed, but nowhere we could reach—or even know about.</p>
                <p>After that discovery, we decided to call it a day. We weren’t ready to dig further without understanding what we had just uncovered. So, we took the safe with us. We’ll need more time to figure out where this leads, and what Factory 12 really is.</p>
                <p>For those curious, we’ve retyped the first document and uploaded it to the <a href="documents.html" class="document-link">Documents section</a>.</p>
                <p>Oh, and one more thing. After we found this stuff, we figured we needed a better way to share our discoveries. We asked one of our tech-savvy friends to help set up a website for us. We just wanted something simple, but after we told him what we found today, he decided to make it... way creepier. Said it just “fit the vibe” of what we were dealing with.</p>
                <p>Can’t say he’s wrong, though. The site is live now, and it definitely captures the eerie feeling we got from that office. We’ll be using it to upload any new findings, so stay tuned.</p>
