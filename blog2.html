                <p>We came back today. The office was waiting, just like before. But this time, the fog covered this area. it wass thick, making everything beyond a few steps ahead disappear. The office was barely visible until we were standing right in front of it.</p>
                <p>Inside fog made it harder to see. We came to hall we previously entered everything was exactly how we left it, papers scattered, desks untouched but something was different. Or maybe it wasn’t. It’s hard to tell in this place. Without watches or clocks it hard to tell time by just looking outside.</p>

                <p>We found more documents today. Old, yellowed pages stored away in a filing cabinet that didn’t seem that much rusted compared the others. They were maps, hand-drawn, like someone had been tracing paths through the forest. One path stood out. It led to Factory 12, marked by shaky arrows and strange symbols. Whoever drew this wasn’t just mapping; they were warning. The words were hard to read, but we could make out enough: <em>“Do not go after dark.”</em>  (or maybe dusk)</p>

                <p>The fog outside was darker now. We decided to leave before we got lost in it.</p>

                <p>Out the back door, the path from the map stretched out in front of us locked behind tall fences, just barely visible through the fog. It wasn’t there the last time we visited, at least not like this. The road cut through the trees, leading straight to Factory 12, according to the map we found. But something about it felt off too quiet, too still. We could barely see a few feet ahead, but we knew the factory was out there. Somewhere.</p>

                <p>The sun was setting, or at least we think it was. The fog blurred everything, including time. The warning felt heavier now, the air colder. We could feel the pull of the road, but none of us spoke. Not tonight. Not now. Something about that path wasn’t right.</p>

                <p>We set up camp near the office, just far enough that the road and whatever was waiting at the end of it wouldn’t see us. A small tent in the clearing, hidden behind a wall of trees. As the last bit of light faded, the fog thickened, wrapping everything in a cold, silence.</p>

                <p>There’s a noise out there now. Soft, like somme old machinery, but slower. We can’t see anything through the fog. Maybe tomorrow, if the fog lifts. If it ever lifts. We’ll try again then.</p>

                <p>For now, we wait</p>
